Here's a list of common performance and architectural problems or concepts related to development, especially relevant to relational databases (SQL) and non-relational databases (NoSQL like MongoDB):

1. N+1 Query Problem
Description: Multiple queries generated due to lazy loading.
Solution: Use eager loading or optimized joins.
2. Overfetching and Underfetching
Description: Fetching more or less data than required.
Solution: Use precise queries or GraphQL for exact data needs.
3. Data Denormalization vs. Normalization
Description: Denormalization improves read performance but increases storage; normalization reduces redundancy but can lead to complex joins.
Solution: Balance based on read/write needs.
4. Indexing Issues
Description: Missing or excessive indexing can slow down query performance.
Solution: Use appropriate indexes, analyze query performance.
5. Query Locking and Deadlocks
Description: Queries lock rows or tables, leading to potential deadlocks.
Solution: Use proper transaction isolation levels, avoid long-running transactions.
6. Sharding and Partitioning
Description: Horizontal scaling can lead to uneven data distribution and hotspots.
Solution: Use effective shard keys or partitioning strategies.
7. Document Size Limits in MongoDB
Description: MongoDB documents have a size limit (16MB).
Solution: Use GridFS for large files, split large documents.
8. Write Amplification in NoSQL
Description: Multiple disk writes due to replication and compaction.
Solution: Optimize write patterns and use write concerns judiciously.
9. Cache Invalidation
Description: Ensuring cache stays synchronized with the database.
Solution: Use cache expiry, invalidation strategies, or read-through/write-through caching.
10. Eventual Consistency vs. Strong Consistency
Description: Trade-offs between consistency models in distributed databases.
Solution: Choose based on the applicationâ€™s tolerance for stale data.
11. Schema Design Pitfalls
Description: Poor schema design can lead to inefficient queries and storage.
Solution: Normalize data, use appropriate data types, and avoid unnecessary fields.
12. Data Migration Challenges
Description: Moving data between different schemas or databases can be complex.
Solution: Use migration tools, maintain backward compatibility.
13. Handling Large Data Sets
Description: Querying and processing large datasets can be resource-intensive.
Solution: Use pagination, batching, and aggregation pipelines (MongoDB).
14. Replication Lag
Description: Delays in data replication between primary and secondary nodes.
Solution: Monitor replication lag, optimize network and disk IO.
15. Inconsistent Data Models in NoSQL
Description: Flexible schemas can lead to inconsistent data models.
Solution: Define clear document structures, use validation.
16. ACID vs. BASE
Description: Relational databases offer ACID properties, NoSQL often uses BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).
Solution: Choose based on transactional requirements.
17. Batch Processing vs. Real-Time Processing
Description: Choosing between batch processing (e.g., data warehousing) and real-time processing (e.g., streaming data).
Solution: Use based on latency requirements.
18. Query Optimization
Description: Poorly written queries can degrade performance.
Solution: Use query analyzers, rewrite queries, use indexes effectively.
19. Data Duplication in NoSQL
Description: NoSQL encourages data duplication for performance, which can lead to update anomalies.
Solution: Carefully manage updates and maintain consistency.
20. Connection Pooling
Description: High overhead due to establishing new database connections frequently.
Solution: Use connection pooling to reuse database connections efficiently.
21. Hotspotting in NoSQL Databases
Description: Uneven data distribution leading to overloading specific nodes.
Solution: Use better sharding keys, distribute data evenly.
22. Query Execution Plans
Description: Inefficient query execution plans can slow down performance.
Solution: Analyze and optimize execution plans, use hints if necessary.
23. Logging and Monitoring Overhead
Description: Extensive logging and monitoring can degrade performance.
Solution: Log essential information, optimize monitoring tools.
24. Concurrency Control
Description: Handling concurrent data access in a multi-user environment.
Solution: Use optimistic or pessimistic locking as needed.
25. Backup and Restore Challenges
Description: Ensuring data integrity and availability during backups.
Solution: Use incremental backups, automate backups, and test restores.
Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial for building efficient, scalable, and robust applications.
